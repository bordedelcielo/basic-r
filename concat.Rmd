1.  Create two strings with your first and last name, respectively. Then concatenate them, and print the new value as "My name is \<your newly created concatenated variable will go here\>"

    ```{r}
my_first_name <- 'John'
my_last_name <- 'Wick'
my_full_name <- paste(my_first_name, my_last_name)
paste('My name is', my_full_name)
    ```

2.  What values can a BOOLEAN contain?
True or False
